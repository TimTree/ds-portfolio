title: Analyzing the Top 1000 Marathon Times Summary
---

When we hear about marathons, we often focus on the top elite runners. Sometimes, it's interesting to see how our perception of runners change if we analyze a larger set of 1000 runners. We discuss variance in times between the 1st and 1000th place runners and which countries hold the 1000 runners in each group.
